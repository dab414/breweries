    simple approach:
      just a list of most popular breweries in the area
        defined by yelp / twitter engagement / beer rating sites

    complicated approach
      groups all breweries in the competition sphere according to brand-related features
      analyze the most popular brand group
      capture the essence of this group through ... commonly occuring words in the tweets about those breweries in the group?
      display common characteristics of the breweries, representative tweet . . . etc



what does success look like in each region
    framing the problem seems difficult...
    revolves around the concept of theme..? ie, brand
    almost like a more granular-level clustering of breweries within a region based on (mostly) non-location features
    a user comes to this app with the question "what (thematic) changes can i make to make my brewery more successful (ie popular)"
    this is a strange blend of supervised and unsupervised learning
      on one hand, i want to abstract away from breweries themselves into a group of themes (totally data driven)
      but then use popularity data to derive the optimal theme

    so you define region similarity based on a bunch of region-specific data
      but then maybe turn around and, within a region, use that data to predict success for a given region and make recommendations
