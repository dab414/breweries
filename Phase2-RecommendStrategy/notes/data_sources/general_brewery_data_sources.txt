## GENERAL ##

	simple breakdown of economic impact of breweries (or beer, more generally) by state

https://www.brewersassociation.org/statistics-and-data/
	i think this is where the link before this one came from
	this links to what's essentially a data-driven blog, looks like they have a tight leash on the good stuff, though

https://www.brewerydb.com/developers
	this might be the money spot
	might be the best way of trying to get a metric for distribution
	has tons of features for lots of breweries
	hard to get a handle on exactly how much data i could get through their api..
	python api seems powerful:

	also they have brewery-specific pages:

## SOCIAL MEDIA ##

https://www.rivaliq.com/explore/craft-beer/
	rivaliq is a site that claims to analyze social media success
	the linked page shows some of what they consider to be brewery success on social media
	the first bits of information presented are actually really cool aggregate, longitudinal measures 
	looks to be mostly: 
		how much are people posting about beers from the brewery
		how much attention are those posts getting

twitter
	would be informative to get data on how well developed each breweries twitter presence is
	as well as 'buzz' around the brewery, how many people are tweeting about it, the general gist of the tweets

untappd
	one of the largest beer-specific social-media type sites
	regarded as more of the facebook for beer, not really esoteric enough for true beer nerds
