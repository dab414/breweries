  after selecting only microbreweries in the continental 48, we're down to about only 2300 breweries
  i still think that k = 150 looks reasonable
  i get about ~ 20 clusters with < 5 breweries, could prob just prune these

  there's an id var already in breweries.csv... but idk what it comes from... i think im just gonna overwrite it with my own id var
