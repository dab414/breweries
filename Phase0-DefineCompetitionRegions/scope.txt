  input

    user selects a city / region that they own a brewery in or wish to open one

  output

    map reveals top ~5 locations highest in similarity to target area
      where candidate areas have some minimum number of breweries

implementation

  how to define regions?

    city-wise approach:
      there are only 97 cities with > 10 breweries
      in total, this only captures 2262 of the 8079 breweries in US

    clustering approach:
      eliminate all breweries that don't have x breweries within y mile radius (not representative of a competitive area)
      cluster according to long and lat only
      set k arbitrarily high
      desired outcome:
        ~ >200 clusters representing different 'competition spheres'
        competition spheres ought to be large in sparse states, small in dense ones

  I ALSO NEED TO DEFINE SOME TYPE OF REGION SIMILARITY
    in such a way that, given a new observation, i can say, you are most similar to these k regions


this approach is starting to feel too complex
