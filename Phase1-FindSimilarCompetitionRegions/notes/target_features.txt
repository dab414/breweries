some features that i'd ideally like to have in the final data

  brewery-relevant
    tap water data
      https://www.ewg.org/tapwater/search-results.php?zip5=18015&searchtype=zip
      looks like this dude might have already done the work for me:
        https://github.com/albertovilla/ewg
    
    some indicator of how many breweries are in the surrounding area
      for existing competition areas, this can just be how many breweries are in the cluster
      for user-input zip code, this would need to be more complicated
    
    maybe a count of restaurants generally
      this is a type of bayesian logic
      p(b | r) = p(r | b) * p(b) / p(r)
      ^ assuming a restaurant can be a brewery or non-brewery, what's the probability of brewery given restaurant
        eh something about that doesn't work cuz p(r | b) is always 1

    something about legal restrictions
      different rules for micro breweries / brewpubs
      https://www.crowdspring.com/blog/how-to-start-a-brewery-business/
      https://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/three-tier-system-impacts-craft-beer 
      this seems important and dificult to get a handle on
        need something like this: https://www.craftbeer.com/craft-beer-muses/three-tier-system-impacts-craft-beer
          but of course these guys block access


  basic demographics
    age seems pretty important
    real estate prices
